# MEDS INSPECT üïµÔ∏è

MEDS (Medical Event Data Standard) is "the simplest possible standard for health AI" (https://medical-event-data-standard.github.io/). 

But after building your own MEDS ETL you might be wondering:
- Is my ETL missing data?
- What codes are contained in my dataset?
- How does my data compare to other MEDS datasets?

.. and many more questions related to data exploration. 

MEDS-Inspect is an interactive data visualization app that supports you in your data quest.
